/**
 * Domains — cron entry point (#154).
 *
 * Refreshes registry details, runs the DNS / email-security / certificate
 * checks, runs the optional Certificate Transparency and look-alike watches,
 * then sends whatever alerts are due. See includes/domains/scheduler.php.
 *
 * HOURLY is the right schedule. Each run works for up to four minutes on the
 * domains that most need it (never looked up, oldest check first), so a large
 * register is covered across a few runs; alerts are fire-once, so running more
 * often never sends anything twice.
 *
 *   Linux    0 * * * *  /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron/domains.php
 *   Windows  Task Scheduler, hourly, running php.exe with the full script path
 *   HTTP     https://your-freeitsm/cron/domains.php?token=…
 *
 * Without a cron the module still works: opening Domains runs a short batch at
 * most once an hour (Domains → Settings → Monitoring). That is a fallback, not a
 * scheduler — if nobody opens the module, nothing is refreshed.
 *
 * SECURITY (HTTP only): ?token= must match the encrypted `domain_cron_token`
 * setting (seeded by Database Verification; `php scripts/cron_token.php` prints
 * it). No token configured means the HTTP door is SHUT. CLI needs no token.
