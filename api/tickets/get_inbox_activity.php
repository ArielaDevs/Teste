/**
 * API Endpoint: has anything new arrived? - one number, for the inbox to poll.
 *   GET → { success, marker }
 *
 * `marker` is the id of the newest message (email, chat message, reply or note
 * row in `emails`) on any ticket this analyst can see. The inbox polls it every
 * minute alongside its own mailbox check, and when it goes up runs the same
 * refresh as the ↻ button.
 *
 * Why it exists: the inbox only refreshed when the mailbox check IT ran found
 * mail. A WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Teams or Mattermost message arrives at the
 * server through a webhook, and mail collected by the scheduled task arrives
 * without the browser - neither ever told an open inbox, so a new chat ticket
 * sat unseen until somebody pressed refresh.
 *
 * Deliberately says nothing but a number: no subject, no sender, no count, so it
 * reveals nothing a refresh would not show anyway. Scoped to the analyst's
 * companies, so another company's traffic never makes this inbox refresh.
