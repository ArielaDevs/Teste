/**
 * Serve an email attachment to the requester who owns the ticket.
 *
 * The portal could show a thread but never hand back a FILE, so when an analyst
 * emailed someone a form, a driver or a screenshot, the one place that person
 * was told to look couldn't give it to them.
 *
 * This is the portal twin of api/tickets/get_attachment.php. The difference is
 * the authorisation model: the analyst version asks "can this analyst reach the
 * ticket's company", this one asks "did this requester raise this ticket". Both
 * resolve the ticket THROUGH the attachment's email rather than trusting anything
 * in the URL, so ids can't be enumerated into someone else's files.
