/**
 * API Endpoint: analyst sends a file (image, document, …) out over a
 * messaging channel from the ticket reading pane.
 *
 * Contributed in PR #159 (turbay-a); reworked at merge time - see the wiki page
 * Telegram-Channel-Developer-Guide, "Sending attachments".
 *
 * The file twin of send_message.php — same recipient/window/channel
 * resolution, but multipart/form-data (ticket_id + file + optional caption)
 * instead of a JSON body, because a browser cannot put a file into JSON.
 *
 * The DB row + final attachment file are created BEFORE the provider is
 * asked to send — unlike send_message.php, which sends first and records
 * after. Twilio needs a URL to fetch the bytes FROM (it never takes an
 * upload), and that URL has to point at something that already exists at its
 * final path; Meta and Telegram upload the bytes directly and would be fine
 * with the old order, but one shared order for every provider is less to get
 * wrong than a branch per provider. A failed send - or a file that fails
 * validation - rolls all of it back, so nothing lingers in the thread looking
 * like it went out.
 *
 * TelegramProvider, MetaCloudProvider and TwilioProvider implement
 * MessagingProvider::sendMedia(); SlackProvider and FreeitsmProvider (web chat)
 * don't yet — their base-class default throws "not supported for this channel
 * yet", which this endpoint surfaces as an ordinary error, not a 500.
