/**
 * Public, unauthenticated media server for ONE outbound attachment — the
 * companion to webhook.php, but outbound: Twilio's WhatsApp API sends media
 * by URL rather than accepting an upload, so it has to fetch the bytes from
 * somewhere reachable on the internet. This is that somewhere.
 *
 *   GET /api/messaging/media.php?id=<email_attachments.id>&exp=<unix ts>&token=<hmac>
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, not a general file host:
 *   - the token is an HMAC over (id, exp) using the app's own encryption key
 *     (messagingOutboundMediaToken()) — nobody can mint one without server-side
 *     code, and it is bound to exactly one attachment
 *   - exp is checked server-side; an expired link 403s even with a
 *     correctly-computed token for the (id, exp) pair it was issued for
 *   - only serves a row this app itself created as an OUTBOUND channel
 *     attachment (email_attachments joined to an Outbound, non-email emails
 *     row) — an inbound attachment, or an ordinary email attachment, is not
 *     reachable through this endpoint even with a forged token, because the
 *     query itself excludes them
