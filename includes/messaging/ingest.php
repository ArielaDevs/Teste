/**
 * ─── Telegram identity: who is this chat? ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Contributed in PR #159 (turbay-a) and rebuilt at merge time. The full story,
 * with the bugs the first version had, is on the wiki:
 * Telegram-Channel-Developer-Guide.
 *
 * Telegram identifies a chat by an opaque number that says nothing about who the
 * person is (WhatsApp, by contrast, identifies them by phone number). So:
 *
 *   1. The first message from a chat gets a PLACEHOLDER requester, exactly like
 *      every other channel. The ticket is never held up.
 *   2. The bot asks, once, for the person's phone number through Telegram's own
 *      "Share phone number" button. Telegram vouches for that number (only the
 *      sender's OWN contact card is accepted - see TelegramProvider::parseInbound).
 *   3. If the number belongs to exactly one person in the right company, the
 *      chat is linked to them and the placeholder's tickets move to them.
 *
 * 🔴 THE RULES THAT MAKE THIS SAFE (each one is a bug the first version had):
 *
 *   - Only the chat's OWN PLACEHOLDER is ever merged away. Once a chat is linked
 *     to a real person, a later phone share changes NOBODY: no tickets move, no
 *     account is deleted, no phone field is overwritten. The first version
 *     treated "whoever the chat is linked to" as the placeholder, so a second
 *     share moved a real person's every ticket - email ones included - to
 *     someone else and then deleted them.
 *   - Only tickets that came in through THIS channel move. A placeholder is
 *     keyed on the chat id, which is the same on every bot, so another company's
 *     bot can share it.
 *   - Matching is scoped to the company the channel files tickets into, and only
 *     an UNAMBIGUOUS number matches. Office phone fields are often a shared
 *     switchboard, and "first match wins" handed one person's tickets to another.
 *   - The link is per CHANNEL (bot), not per chat id: company A's bot linking
 *     someone must not decide who they are on company B's bot.
 *   - What happened goes in the ticket's audit trail, never into the customer's
 *     own message text (or, as it could, an analyst's reply).
