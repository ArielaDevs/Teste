/**
 * Ticket sensitivity: Normal or Confidential (discussion #62, step 1).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS BEFORE MANAGERS DO
 * ----------------------------------
 * Managers are coming to the self-service portal: people who can read tickets
 * raised by the people they manage. Before that ships, a ticket has to be able
 * to say "not for my manager". Someone emailing HR about a diagnosis, or about
 * how to raise a grievance against their own manager, must never have that
 * ticket shown to the manager. Confidential is how a ticket says so; step 3
 * decides what a manager sees of one (default: nothing at all).
 *
 * THE DANGEROUS MOMENT IS BEFORE ANYONE HAS LOOKED
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * An analyst can mark a ticket confidential - but a grievance emailed to HR
 * sits unmarked until someone gets to it. So a ticket also becomes confidential
 * WITHOUT anyone deciding, when:
 *   - the requester ticks Confidential when raising it in the portal;
 *   - it arrives through a mailbox set to confidential (an HR mailbox);
 *   - it is in, or is moved into, a service-desk department set to confidential;
 *   - it is split from, or merged with, a confidential ticket.
 *
 * 🔴 DEFAULTS ONLY EVER RAISE. Nothing automatic ever makes a ticket Normal
 * again: moving a ticket OUT of HR leaves it confidential until a person
 * decides otherwise. Lowering is always a deliberate act by an analyst.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY PATH THAT CREATES A TICKET MUST CALL ticketSensitivityApplyDefaults()
 * after its insert. There were eleven such paths when this was written and only
 * two went through TicketsService, so a hook in the service alone would have
 * missed nine - including the mailbox ingest, which is where the HR email lands.
 * The list is in the wiki: Confidential-Tickets-Developer-Guide.
 *
 * Confidential does NOT restrict analysts. Who on the service desk can see a
 * ticket is still decided by teams, departments and companies, as before.
