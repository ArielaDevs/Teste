/**
 * The one HTTP door for the hypervisor syncs (Proxmox VE, VMware Cloud Director).
 *
 * Added when PR #167 was merged. Each engine had its own cURL block; they now
 * share this one, for three reasons:
 *
 *   1. HTTPS ONLY. Every request carries a credential - a Proxmox API token
 *      secret, or a Director password in Basic auth - so plain http would send
 *      it across the network readable by anyone on the path. validateHost()
 *      refuses http:// when a server is saved, and request() refuses it again
 *      in case a row was written some other way.
 *
 *   2. THE CA BUNDLE. With "Verify certificate" ticked, the PR set
 *      CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER but no CURLOPT_CAINFO, so on WAMP and some
 *      Docker and Linux hosts a perfectly valid certificate failed with
 *      "unable to get local issuer certificate" - GH #129 again. A ticked box
 *      now goes through sslApplyCurl($ch, true), the same helper as every other
 *      integration: verification forced on, with the install's bundle.
 *
 *   3. TESTS. Neither product can be run in CI. $testTransport lets
 *      tests/hypervisor-sync.php answer as a stand-in Proxmox or Director and
 *      drive the real sync code - including every rule about what gets deleted.
