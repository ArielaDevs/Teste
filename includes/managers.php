/**
 * Managers in the self-service portal (discussion #62, step 3).
 *
 * A MANAGER is a portal user who may read the tickets raised by other portal
 * users - "the Head of Logistics sees Logistics' tickets". This file is the ONE
 * place that decides who that is; every portal endpoint asks
 * portalTicketAccess() and nothing else, so an attachment link, a document or a
 * recording can never be a way round a rule the ticket page keeps.
 *
 * WHERE MANAGEMENT COMES FROM
 * ---------------------------
 *  1. The directory: users.manager_id, filled from AD's manager attribute by
 *     directory sync. Someone's line manager can see their tickets - switchable
 *     (managers_directory), direct reports only or the whole chain below.
 *  2. Management lines set up in FreeITSM (`manager_grants`), any mix of:
 *        everyone | a person | a people group | a department name | their reports
 *     plus EXCLUSIONS (a person, a group, a department). An exclusion always
 *     wins, whatever granted the access - including the directory - because
 *     "everyone in Sales except the person raising a grievance about me" is the
 *     case the exclusion exists for.
 *
 * THE RULES (agreed with Ed)
 * --------------------------
 *  - OFF until switched on (managers_enabled), and FAIL CLOSED: before Database
 *    Verification has added the sensitivity and view columns, nobody is a
 *    manager, because a confidential ticket could not be told apart.
 *  - Same company only, both ways: the person must be in the manager's company
 *    - where NO company means the Default company, the documented convention
 *    for every row a company owns (Multi-Tenancy-Isolation). Somebody who has
 *    never set up companies, or never filed these people, must not have to do
 *    anything extra to make managers work (Ed) -
 *    AND so must the ticket (a ticket can be moved to another company).
 *  - A manager who has left sees nothing. Whether managers keep seeing the
 *    tickets of people who have left is a setting, on by default - an open
 *    ticket still needs oversight after its requester goes (Ed).
 *  - Confidential tickets: nothing (default), a stub, or everything
 *    (managers_confidential).
 *  - What a manager may DO - reply, close - is a setting; viewing is the floor.
 *  - Department names are free text (users.department), matched ignoring case
 *    and surrounding spaces. A renamed department therefore loses its line;
 *    System -> Managers warns about lines that match nobody.
