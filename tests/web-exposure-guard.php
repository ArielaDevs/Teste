/**
 * Nothing in tests/ may be reachable over HTTP.
 *
 *   php tests/web-exposure-guard.php
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. FreeITSM is deployed by putting the repository in the
 * document root — that is what the Dockerfile's `COPY . /var/www/html/` does and
 * how a hand install is normally laid out. For a long time that published this
 * directory. A request to /tests/<anything>.php returned 200 and ran it.
 *
 * That is worse than it sounds, because these are not pure unit tests. They
 * drive the real code against the real database: they create forms, assets,
 * contracts, documents and working analyst accounts — one of them with the
 * password 'x', which is printed in a public repository — and each deletes what
 * it made only in its closing lines. Over HTTP that becomes:
 *
 *   - an unauthenticated write endpoint anybody who reads the repo can trigger;
 *   - which a client can abandon, or a web SAPI's 30-second limit can cut off,
 *     part way through, leaving the account or the rows behind (the command line
 *     has no such limit, which is why this never happened to a developer);
 *   - whose failure messages print real records back to the requester — one
 *     prints the titles of actual knowledge articles;
 *   - and which deletes by pattern, so `DELETE FROM assets WHERE hostname LIKE
 *     'ZZIMP-%'` takes a customer's matching row with it.
 *
 * 🔑 THE DEFENCE HAS THREE LAYERS AND THIS TEST CHECKS ALL THREE, because each
 * one covers a case the others cannot:
 *
 *   1. A `PHP_SAPI !== 'cli'` guard on the first line of every script. This is
 *      the only layer that travels WITH the file, so it works in a git clone, on
 *      nginx, on Apache without AllowOverride, and inside an image somebody
 *      built themselves. It cannot cover the .html and .sh files.
 *   2. tests/.htaccess and tests/web.config — the whole directory denied, which
 *      does cover those files. Apache and IIS only.
 *   3. tests/ excluded from .dockerignore and denied in deploy/nginx, so the
 *      official image never contains it and the shipped nginx config blocks it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Layer 1 is the one that matters most and the one most easily forgotten:
 * a new test file is written by copying an old one or from scratch, and nothing
 * about leaving the guard off would ever fail. That is the shape this codebase
 * keeps being bitten by — a guard a human has to remember is not a guard — so
 * the list of files is taken from the DIRECTORY, never from a list kept here.
